Agile Methods
*************

:term:`Agile methods` are groups of practices of piloting and realization of projects. 
They originate from the Agile Manifesto, written in 2001, which uses the term "agile" to refer to multiple existing methods.

Agile methods are more pragmatic than traditional methods, involve the client as much as possible and allow a great reactivity to his requests. They are based on an iterative, incremental and adaptive development cycle and must respect four fundamental values, based on twelve principles, from which a base of practices, either common or complementary, derives.

The Kanban methodology comes from the Japanese automotive industry. It was created with the aim of optimizing the production capacity.

The Kanban method is based on the continuous improvement of production processes to enable lean production management.

The Kanban approach is a stock management method that allows you to produce on demand.

The main objective is to balance production and demand.


   **With Kanban, you can create a new Kanban board for**
   
      * Tickets,
      * Activities,
      * Actions,
      * Requirements
   
   * Add / Remove columns to an existing Kanban board
   * Direct update of elements

  You will need to define:
 
  * **Name** for the new Kanban board
      
  * **Type of item:** you can define a Kanban of Tickets, Activities, Actions or Requirements
      
      
  When you have selected the item type, you must then define the type of Kanban board to apply:
            
  * **Status:** you will manage the most standard "status based" kanban board
  * **Target product version:** you can distribute the tickets among the target product version
  * **Planning activity:** You will be able to send tickets among planning activities, which can be your Sprints in the Scrum method.
  
  .. seealso:: See :ref:`ticket-planning-activity` on the tickets screen
    
    
.. _kanban-shared:
    
  You can choose directly if you want to share the newly created kanban with other users so that they can use it.
  
  When you share a Kanban, other users will see your share in the list of shared Kanbans.

  .. image:: /images/GUI/AGILE_BOX_SharedKanban.png

  Each time you access the Kanban screen, the last selected Kanban map is displayed.   





      
.. _kanban-newcolumn:

  * Click on |addColumnKanban| to create a new Column 
  
  The pop up is different depending on the type of kanban board created beforehand.

     
  In the case of a status arrangement, the columns contain items from one status to another in the order of presence of your workflow.
   
  The next column will show the next status following your workflow to the last or the status you have determined.

.. _kanban-restriction:          
            
 .. compound::  |five| Fields restriction

   As with other ProjeQtOr screens, you can restrict the display of items in the created columns of your kanban.

   You can restrict items by name, manager, version, and sort them by ID, name, manager, status, or target version product.
   
   
   
.. _kanban-filters:          
            
 .. compound::  |six| Advanced filters

   Click the icon to set an advanced filter.

   The advanced filter is used to define a clause to filter and sort

.. _kanban-infobar:          
            
 .. compound::  |seven| Show / Hide informations
     
  .. compound:: Show work on elements
       
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_WorkElement.png
    :alt: Work on element
         
   You can view the work information of items on each column.
         
   The estimated work, actual work, and work remaining information on the selected item can be displayed
   
   If your profile is not allowed to see the job, you will not have access to this option.
   
   The format for displaying the job (days or hours) depends on the overall configuration:
   
      * **unit for real work allocation** for Tickets
      * **unit for workload** for Activities

       
  .. compound:: Show closed items
  
   You switch to archive mode. You can view the closed elements.     
       
       
  .. compound:: Show large element
  
   By default, Kanban board columns display two tiles side by side.

   By displaying the tiles in wide mode, each tile takes the maximum width of the column.
  
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_LargeKanban.png
    :alt: Large kanban
    
    Wide kanban board display

  .. compound:: Hide backlog
  
   When you create a kanban, you do not yet have columns representing a state, a set of states or even versions.
   
   The tiles then appear in a Backlog column.
   
   You have the option to hide this column.
    
    
.. rubric:: Element management

Find below the details of the tiles of your kanbans


 .. compound:: Details of an element
 
  .. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_TileKanban.png
  
  |one| ID of the element with in the background the project color
  
  |two| The type of the element
  
  |three| The name of the element
  
  |four| Status in which the tile is located in relation to your :ref:`workflow`
  
  |five| The target product version
  
  |six| The planning activity or parent activity related to the element
  
  |seven| The description of the element 
  
  |eight| Estimated work | Real work | Left work
  
  |nine| Responsible of work Photo - The name is displayed on mouse over
  
  |ten| Priority of the element - Priorities are customizable. See :ref:`list of values<priority>`
  
  |eleven| Add a note. The number of notes is displayed on the icon
  
  |twelve| Edit the element
  
  |thirteen| Go to the element screen
  
 
  
  

 .. compound:: Edit an element
 
  Click on |Save| to save the modification.
  
  If a checklist is available then click on the icon to display it.

 .. compound:: Moves an element
 
  To move tickets, activities, or anything else from your kanban, drag and drop a ticket into the corresponding column.

  .. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_DragDrop.png
    :alt: Move an element
   
    Move an element

  The heading of the moved element then changes to green when it is on a column where the movement is allowed and is red when it is on a column where the movement is prohibited.

  If the Kanban is arranged as statuses, the new status after move, will be the first status of the range defined for the column.

  For Kanbans based on the target product version and planning activities, the new field value will simply be the target.


 .. compound:: Forbidden moves
 
  Displacements will change the value of the corresponding field for the moved element.
  
  But the "status" change must respect the workflow configuration for the given item type. This is why some movements are prohibited.
  
  Permitted moves are easily identified from prohibited moves by the color of the Ticket header or the moved Activity.  
  
  
 .. compound:: Updating
 
  Depending on the configuration of the ticket type, some state changes may require the definition of new fields.

  For example, in the default configuration, when changing to the "assigned" state, "responsible" is required, and when transitioning to the "terminated" state, "result" is required ".

  In this case, when you move a ticket in the Kanban columns, a pop-up window appears to allow you to enter the missing value if it is not already defined.

Each list acts as the standard "linked element" element present on almost every element screen.

You can then list an item to add it to the list of related items, but also create a new item to add to the list, just like for the Linked Items feature.

All linked items through this feature will appear in linked items in the meeting.

There is a slight difference with related items, when you click on the name of an item, you are not redirected to it. 
   
It simply opens in a pop-up form, allowing you to update it without leaving the LiveMeeting screen.
