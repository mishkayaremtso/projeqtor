Document versioning
-------------------

This section allows to manage version list of document.

Document versioning allows to keep different version at each evolution of the document.

Document can evolve and a new file is generated at each evolution.

Type of versioning must be defined for a document.

A document can evolve following four ways defined as versioning type :

   .. compound:: **Evolutive**
   
    * Version is a standard Vx.y format. 
    * It is the most commonly used versioning type.
    * Major updates increase x and reset y to zero. 
    * Minor updates increase y.
   
   .. compound:: **Chronological**
   
    * Version is a date. 
    * This versioning type is commonly used for periodical documents.
    * For instance : weekly boards.
   
   .. compound:: **Sequential**

    * This versioning type is commonly used for recurring documents.
    * For instance : Meeting reviews.
   
   .. compound:: **Custom**
   
    * Version is manually set. 
    * This versioning type is commonly used for external documents, when version is not managed by the tool, or when the format cannot fit any other versioning type.



.. rubric:: Document viewer

Approval process
----------------
      
You can define approvers for a document.

Only users assigned to the project linked to the document can be added.
  
* Click on |Add| to add an approver
* Click on |Delete| to delete an approver


.. rubric:: The approvers

When an approver is created in the list, the approver is also automatically added to the latest version of the document.
   
When adding a version to the document, approvers are automatically added to the version.

Each approver can see the list of documents to approve on their Today screen.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/DOCUMENT_ZONE_TodayDoc.png
   :alt: Document to approve
   
   Documents to be approved on the today screen
   
On the Documents screen, the approver can approve or reject the document.

All approvers of the document can view the response of other approvers.   


.. figure:: /images/GUI/DOCUMENT_ZONE_Approve.png
   :alt: Document to approve
   
   Documents to be approved on the today screen
   

Once the document is **approved**, the line is then checked and the date and time of the approval recorded.

If the document is **rejected**, the line is then marked with a cross.


  .. compound:: Approval status
  
   This status allows you to globally track the status of the approval.
   
   It can be used in a filter, like all the other fields of the document object.
   
   calculated according to the approval status of the latest version of the document and may take the following values:
   
   * **Without approval:** if no approver has been added to the list of approvers
   * **Rejected:** if at least one approver rejected the version of the document
   * **Pending approval:** if there is at least one approver who has not approved the document and no one has yet rejected the version of the document
   * **Approved:** if all approvers approved the document.  
   
   .. note:: 
      The quick search only display documents that are in directories to which the user has rights.
  
  .. compound:: Send a reminder email to approvers

   Send an email to approvers who have not yet validated the document. 

   Those who have already validated it will not receive this email.

   The sending will be effective if an email address has been registered for the user.

.. index:: Document (Directories management) 

.. _document-directory:

Document directories
--------------------

Document directories management allows to define a structure for document storage.

.. rubric:: Location

* The files of document will be stored in the folder defined by the parameters  **Document root** and **Location**.

* **Document root** is defined in :ref:`Global parameters<file-directory-section>` screen. 

* **Location** is automatically defined as «Parent directory» / «Name».

* **Product** will be the default to new stored documents in this directory.
   
   - If the project is specified, the list of values contains the products linked the selected project.
      
   - If the project is not specified, the list of values contains all products defined.

* The **Default type** will be the default to new stored documents in this directory.


.. _directory-access-rights:

.. rubric:: Directory access rights

* The list of documents only displays Documents that are in directories for which the user has read rights.

* You can define the access rights to documents according to the profile at each level of the document directory tree.

* There is no notion of inheriting rights to subdirectories.

* You define for each profile the CRUD right (create / read / update / delete) on each directory.

* The rights defined in the "Project dependent data access" rights screen will only be used as a definition of default values when creating a directory.

See: :ref:`Documents rights per directory<doc-rights-per-directory>` 
  
.. note:: 

   * Note that if a directory is dedicated to a project, the profile used for assigning rights is the user's profile on this project, otherwise it is his default profile.
   
   * The assignment of modification or deletion rights without assigning read rights is inconsistent and will not be taken into account.







Nomenclature
------------

.. rubric:: product designation in the document nomenclature

Possibility to take into account the designation of the product in the nomenclature of documents with the new codes

* {PROD} product designation
* {PROJ / PROD} the project code if specified, otherwise the product designation
* {PROD / PROJ} designation of the product if specified, otherwise the project code
