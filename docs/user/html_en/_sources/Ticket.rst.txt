Tickets
-------

A ticket is a kind of task that cannot be scheduled in a unitary manner.

This is usually a short-lived activity for a single ticket that gives feedback to the issuer or to keep track of the result.

It can be globally planned as a general activity, but not unitarily.

For instance, bugs should be managed through tickets : 

* You can not plan bugs before they are registered.
* You must be able to give a feedback on each bug.
* You can (or at least should) globally plan bug fixing activity. 

.. index:: Ticket (Simple) 

.. topic:: Tickets (simple) 

   * This screen is a limited version of screen "Tickets".

   * When fields and features are available, the description is similar.
    

.. topic:: Restrict the entry of real work in the ticket

   * Possibility to define that only the responsible of ticket can enter real work.
   * This behavior can be set in  :ref:`Global parameters<auto-responsible>` screen.


.. rubric:: Due dates

* Initial and planned due date allows to define a target date for solving the ticket.

 .. compound:: **Initial due date**

    * If a definition of ticket delay exists for giving ticket type and urgency the date is automatically calculated with this delay.
    * :ref:`delay-for-ticket` screen allows to define ticket delay.

 .. compound:: **Planned due date**

    * Is used to define a target date after evaluation.
    * Automatically initialized to the initial due date.

 .. compound:: **Monitoring indicator**

    * Possibility to define indicators to follow the respect of dates values.

    .. describe:: Respect of initial due date/time
    .. describe:: Respect of planned due date/time


.. note::

   Initial due date of the ticket set as read only if it is calculated from the setting of "delays for tickets"

.. rubric:: Product, component and versions fields

* Allows to identify the product and component relating to the issue.
* Identifies from which versions, the issue occurs and to which versions a resolution will be applied.

    * A ticket can identify all versions allocated.
    * Possibility to define a main version and the other versions allocated.
    * See: :ref:`Product concept<product-concept>`.

.. rubric:: Responsible of product


   
   
A responsible can be defined for a product or component.

If a product or component is selected, the responsible defined can be automatically assigned to the ticket.

The passages from an active macro-state to a non-active macro-state (paused or done), are recorded thanks to the start and end dates of each period. This table is updated automatically with calculation of the duration in working hours and the duration in calendar hours when the end date of the period is entered.

In the previous screens, a name of value is set with numeric value.  

Priority numeric value is determined by a simple equation as follows:

.. topic:: Equation

   * [Priority value] = [Urgency value] X [Criticality value] / 2
   * For example:

     * Blocking (4) X Critical (8) / 2  = Critical priority (16)for [Priority value] 

.. rubric:: Default values

* Default values are determined.
* You can change its values while respecting the equation defined above.
